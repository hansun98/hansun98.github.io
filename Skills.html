<br>The shriek from the two girls was so loud and sharp that I was almost startled to fall by them. But when I came closer, I did the same, screaming out uncontrollably, as most girls would do. Why? There were two rats in the collection box of used bottles! Just looking at the sneaky shadows of these “Mickey Mouse” would give you the creeps.

<br>This was definitely an unusual incident for us, the participants of the Green Recycling Activity, in our daily quests. However, as the organizer, I had to admit the fact that since I launched the campaign, there were so many unforgettable experiences, and that was just one of them.

<br>It started first from the considerations of funding for the student union. We set up recycling spots for bottles and waste paper throughout the campus, and then sold the collections to the recycling center every week. Someone’s got to be first one to eat the crabs. The challenge for us existed in the actual collection process. The slimy liquid flowing from the bottles, the dirty remains dribbling out in the box and some smelly junks around the collection site all presented huge problems to girls like us. We put on masks and protective gloves, and we invited those basketball team boys to help us move around bulky stuff. As our campaign moved on, new challenges kept surfacing in the process for me to tackle.

<br>The biggest challenge, however, was the pricing issue. I gathered quotes of prices from several recycling stations before I settled on which one has the highest bid. Besides, I led the team to separate and categorize waste products in advance so as to trade quickly and effectively. After collecting all the bottles and transporting them to the recycling station, we got into a dilemma: how could we count precisely so many bottles collected? The recycling station suggested counting numbers of bottles by weighing, but we students all knew that would greatly reduce the number. Nevertheless, no one wanted to stand out and negotiate with the stations. “We had never done it before!” But I told myself this was something on my shoulders. I figured out a more efficient way and proposed to count the number of boxes containing exactly the same number of bottles in each box. Meticulously and attentively, I discussed with three stations with the offer of selling the bottles at the highest price they could accept, upon the acceptance of my proposal. I tried my best to be clear and logical, and ultimately I made it: I sold at 250 dollars in one sale, with 10 dollars above the usual margin. After several successful experiences, I became confident, eloquent and very efficient in handling the selling issue.

<br>With our money “streaming in,” I proposed to set up on campus an environmental protection scholarship with the funding earned from the collection movement. Though the funding was not as great as thousands of dollars, it should help poor students in their study and life. And this is absolutely the best thing that I have done ever in my life. And starting this semester, our scholarship officially kicked off to provide funding to three students of disadvantaged families in my school!

<br>Looking back at the things we have done this year, I believe become more outspoken, more

courageous in carrying out my thoughts, and more organized in planning things. As a leader, I could not avoid making speeches or facing many students of the class or grade directly. Anxious at first and a bit shy, I gradually overcame it, and walked proudly to the podium every time. Now I learn the value of being persevering and steadfast in pursuing my goal. No longer a shy person, I led the bottle collecting movement that also changed me. So do not be scared by the mice next time! I know I can do it.</p>
